|  Name: |  Computable Policy |
|  Submitted by: | [Henrique Santos](../User/HenriqueSantos.md "User:HenriqueSantos") |
|  Also Known As: | OWL+PROV |
|  Intent: |  To represent machine-interpetrable and computable policies, supporting automated policy decisions using OWL reasoners. |
|  Domains: | Domain-agnostic |
|  Competency Questions: | <li> What is the effect of a policy?</li><li> Which are the applicable policies during a given timeframe/instant?</li><li> Which are the application policies in a specific geo-location?</li><li> Which policy rule has priority during evaluation?</li> |
|  Solution description: |  OWL+PROV is novel ontology design pattern for representing policies and guidelines using the OWL and PROV semantic web W3C standards. The pattern advocates for the creation of a class hierarchy, which incrementally appends the policy's rules to support the explanation of policy evaluation results. |
|  Reusable OWL Building Block: | [Example 1](owl+prov.ttl) |
|  Consequences: |  Ontologies created following this pattern extend domain knowledge graphs to include the encoding of the policy's rules in class equivalencies, expressed as OWL restrictions over domain entities. |
